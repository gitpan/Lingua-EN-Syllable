Lingua::EN::Syllable - Routine for estimating syllable count in words.

Lingua::EN::Syllable provides one subroutine, syllable(), which
estimates the number of syllables in the word passed to it.  It
guesses correctly about 80-90% of the time, but it's smaller and
faster than a dictionary lookup.  So you can't really use it for
writing random haiku, but you can do things like estimate reading
grade level.

INSTALLATION

Follow the typical steps:  after untarring the distribution into some
random directory, do

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
